    <h1 class="header">An introduction to Nub</h1>
    <h2>What it is</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Nub</b> is a model-view-controller (MVC) plugin for jQuery.
        It allows data stored in a central in-page model to be displayed at different places on the page (the <i>views</i>).
        Updates made to the model data through the Nub controller are immediately reflected in the affected views.
    </p>
    <h2>First steps</h2>
    <p>
        Before using Nub on an HTML page, jQuery and the Nub plugin must be included in your page.
        <pre class="brush: xml">
            &lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;script src="jquery.nub.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h2>A simple example</h2>
    <p>
        Suppose you have a simple JSON object like the following:
        <pre class="brush: js"> { "fruit":"banana" } </pre>
        The object data can be stored in Nub's model with the following code:
        <pre class="brush: js">
            var data = { "fruit":"banana" };
            $.nub.set('/favourite', data );
        </pre>
        This stores the object at the location <b>/favourite</b>.
        We can now display the object's data somewhere within the page using the following HTML:
        <pre class="brush: xml">
            &lt;div class="nub-view" data="/favourite/fruit"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
        This will result in something like the following being shown:
        <div class="example-view">banana</div>
        If we now change the data stored under <b>/favourite</b>:
        <pre class="brush: js">
            $.nub.set('/favourite', { "fruit":"pomegranate" }
        </pre>
        The value in the page will be updated appropriately:
        <div class="example-view">pomegranate</div>
    </p>
    <h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
    <p>
        The following sections delve a bit deeper into Nub's workings.
    </p>
    <h3>Initialization</h3>
    <p>
        When the page is loaded all views in the page are initiated using the following code:
        <pre class="brush: js">
            $.nub.init();
        </pre>
        (This code is usually placed inside a <code>$(document).ready(..)</code> callback function).
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>nub.init</b> method searches the page for any elements marked with the <b>nub-view</b> CSS class and does the
        following:
        <ul>
            <li>If the element has a <b>data</b> attribute then the attribute value is used as the path to an item in the
            Nub data model.
            The element's content will be updated to the value stored in the model.
            (Usually, this is just plain text but Nub can be used to set an element's HTML content this way).
            </li>
            <li>If any of the element's attributes have a value beginning with <b>nub:</b> then the rest of the attribute's
            value is used as the path to a data item and the attribute's value is updated to the text value of that item in
            the model.
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Data paths &amp; contexts</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Data paths</b> are used by Nub to identify the location in the model of a data value.
        A data path is simply a sequence of object <b>property names</b> separated by forward slashes, e.g. as seen above:
        <b>/favourite/fruit</b>.
        Data paths can be absolute or relative.
        Normally (as in the preceeding example) absolute paths are used, and begin with a forward slash.
        However, sometimes it can be convenient to specify a data path as being relative to some other - presumably absolute - path.
        This can be useful if a large number of paths need to be defined which all share the same prefix - i.e. if the paths
        are all referencing different properties of the same object.
        In this case, a <b>context path</b> can be used, and the <b>nub.init</b> function uses the <b>nub-context</b> CSS
        class to identify context elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following example, a series of DIVs are used to display different properties of the same object.
        A parent element with the <b>nub-context</b> class is used to provide a context path for each of the view elements.
        <pre class="brush: xml">
            &lt;div class="nub-context" data="/my-car"&gt;
                &lt;div class="nub-view" data="registration"/&gt;
                &lt;div class="nub-view" data="colour"/&gt;
                &lt;div class="nub-view" data="doors"/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
        This results, for example, in the first element displaying the value stored at <b>/my-car/registration</b> in the model.
    </p>
    <h3 id="forms">Forms</h3>
    <p>
        Any form input can be turned into a model view by adding the <b>nub-view</b> class to the element:
        <pre class="brush: xml">&lt;input class="nub-view" type="text" name="/favourite/colour"/&gt;</pre>
        Inputs are handled a bit differently from other elements: the <b>name</b> attribute (instead of a data attribute)
        is used as the data path; and the input's value is set to the data value.
        Additional to displaying the value stored in the model, the input can now also be used to update the model.
        If a new value is entered into the input then the value stored in the model is updated correspondingly
        (and if other views are observing the same data item then they also will be updated).
    </p>
    <p>
        Forms marked with the <b>nub-form</b> class on their FORM element get special treatment from Nub - the entire form is
        turned into an in-page model.
        This means that the form's inputs contain the actual values stored in the model, and in effect can be edited directly,
        while other elements in the page can observe the form's value and be updated as the form is edited.
        Nub creates a reference to the form model at a special place within the global model, under <b>/nub:forms</b>.
        Each Nub form has a reference to itself created under this location using the form's name
        (if the form isi unnamed then Nub will allocate a unique one; but this is rarely useful, as the name must be know
        if other views are to reference it).
    </p>
    <p>
        This is easiest understood using an example.
        In the following example -
        <ul>
            <li>A form named <b>'some'</b> is marked as a <b>nub-form</b>.</li>
            <li>This form has an input named <b>word</b>.</li>
            <li>Elsewhere in the page, a view element is defined which will display the current value of the input.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="brush: xml">
            &lt;form name="some" class="nub-form"&gt;
                &lt;input name="word" type="text"/&gt;
            ...
            &lt;div class="nub-view" data="/nub:forms/some/word"/&gt;
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nub forms are also able to submit data using Ajax, see the <a href="#remote-data">Remote Data</a> section below.
    </p>
    <h3>Select lists</h3>
    <p>
        It is often useful for the list of options displayed by a select list to be read from somewhere in the model.
        This can be done by marking the SELECT element as a <b>nub-view</b> and giving it a <b>data</b> attribute.
        If the data item stored at the location specified by the data attribute is an array then it will be used
        to populate the select list's options.
        If the data item is a 1-dimensional array then each option will have the same data and value; if the data
        item is a 2-dimensional array then the first item of each array value is used as the option value and the second
        item is used as the option label.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the SELECT list element contains OPTION elements then these won't be replaced by the list data;
        instead, these will be retained and will always be included at the top of the list.
        This is useful, for example, if you always want to display a default item on the list:
        <pre class="brush: xml">
            &lt;select name="pattern" data="/wallpaper/patterns"&gt;
                &lt;option&gt;Please select one...&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;/select&gt;
        </pre>
        Note that the difference between the select's <b>name</b> and <b>data</b> attributes:
        the <i>data</i> attribute specifies where to read the data which generates the list;
        while the <i>name</i> attribute specifies where to store the list's selected value.
    </p>
    <!--
    <h3>Formatting views</h3>
    -->
    <h3>Functional views</h3>
    <p>
        Functions can be registered with Nub as views on data in the model.
        This is useful when you want a value to be calculated from other values in the model, and you want that value to be
        updated whenever the other values are updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        To take a simple example, suppose you want to calculate a value as being the sum of two other values.
        These values will be stored in this model under the location <b>/values</b>.
        We can write a 'sum' function and register it with Nub using the following code:
        <pre class="brush: js">
            function sum() {
                var a = $.nub.get('/values/a');
                var b = $.nub.get('/values/b');
                $.nub.set('/sum', a + b );
            }
            $.nub.view('/values', sum );
        </pre>
        The <b>nub.view</b> function allows a callback function to be registered which will be called whenever an update takes
        place at the specified path.
        Here, the path <b>/values</b> includes updates to <b>/values/a</b> and <b>/values/b</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following HTML uses the previous view function to update the sum of two values whenever the user enters new ones.
        <pre class="brush: xml">
            &lt;input class="nub-view" type="text" name="/values/a"/&gt;
            &lt;input class="nub-view" type="text" name="/values/b"/&gt;
            &lt;span class="nub-view" data="/sum"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Filters</h3>
    <p>
        Filters provide a way to generate new model data from other data already in the model, and are implemented
        using functional views.
        Conceptually, a filter is simply a function which is invoked whenever a data item is updated, and is passed the data
        value as an argument; the value returned by the function is then stored at a separate model location.
        Nub provides the <b>nub.filter</b> function for setting up a filter.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, suppose we have a list of people stored in the model, such as the following:
        <pre class="brush: js" id="people-list">
        [
            { "name":"Andy Matland",   "age":27 },
            { "name":"Jean Decaux",    "age":17 },
            { "name":"Sandy Williams", "age":32 },
            { "name":"Chen Dawei",     "age":16 }
        ]
        </pre>
        If we then want a list generated which only contains the people on the list who are teenagers, we can use the following
        code to set this up:
        <pre class="brush: js">
            function teenagersOnly( people ) {
                var result = [];
                for( var i = 0; i &lt; people.length; i++ ) {
                    if( people[i].age &gt; 12 &amp;&amp; people[i].age &lt; 20 ) {
                        result.push( people[i] );
                    }
                }
                return result;
            }
            $.nub.filter('/everyone', teenagersOnly, '/teenagers');
        </pre>
        The <b>nub.filter</b> command takes three arguments:
        <ol>
        <li>The first is the data to be fed into the filter.
        Here, our original list is stored in the model at <b>/everyone</b>.</li>
        <li>The second is the filter function.
        The list at /everyone is read from the model and passed to this function.</li>
        <li>The third is where in the model to store the value returned by the filter.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Filters can also take arguments, see the <a href="nub-api.html">Nub API</a> documentation for more details.
    </p>
    <h2 id="remote-data">Remote data</h2>
    <p>
        Nub provides a number of mechanisms for passing data between the model and a remote server using Ajax.
    </p>
    <h3>Using forms</h3>
    <p>
        Form models (<a href="#forms">see above</a>), as well as providing access to data within a page form, can also be used to
        read data from and write data to a server.
        Nub uses the form's ACTION and METHOD attributes to decide where to write data to and what HTTP method to use.
        The form model object can then be used to initiate the Ajax operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take the following form as an example:
        <pre class="brush: xml">
        &lt;form name="login" method="POST" action="/login" class="nub-form"&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" name="username"/&gt;
            &lt;input type="password" name="password"/&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
        </pre>
        This is obviously a login form, and has been marked as a Nub form (i.e. because of the class attribute on the FORM element).
        Nub can be used to perform the login action over Ajax with the following code, which for example could be called when the
        user clicks a login button:
        <pre class="brush: js">
            var form = $.nub.get('/nub:forms/login');
            form.submit({
                success: function() { alert('Login success!'); }
            });
        </pre>
        The first line reads the form object from the Nub model.
        This object actually represents the form model, and provides a number of methods for accessing data and loading or
        submitting data.
        The next line submits the form data using Ajax.
        The Ajax call will by default use the HTTP method and action URI specified on the form element;
        however, these can all be overriden using the argument passed to this function.
        (The argument takes all the same properties of the standard jQuery ajax() function call).
        If the form submit is successful then an alert is displayed with a success message.
    </p>
    <p>
        The form object also allows data to be loaded into the form over Ajax, see the <a href="nub-api.html">Nub API</a> documentation for more details.
    </p>
    <h3>Using remote objects</h3>
    <p>
        Remote objects are special objects within Nub's data model which read their data from a remote server using Ajax and
        can write their data back to the server.
        A remote object is created within the model with the <b>nub.remote</b> command:
        <pre class="brush: js">
            var account = $.nub.remote('/remote/account');
        </pre>
        This command creates a new remote object at the location <b>/remote/account</b> in the model.
        (Placing all remote objects under <i>/remote</i> in the model is a Nub convention).
        At this stage, the remote object doesn't contain any data.
        Data could now be written to the object using <b>nub.set()</b>;
        instead, here we will first load data from the server using the remote object's <b>httpGet</b> method:
        <pre class="brush: js">
            account.httpGet('/account-data');
        </pre>
        (Note that here, <b>/account-data</b> is a path on the server from which the HTML page hosting the code was loaded from,
        and not a data path).
        This command will load data from the specified server URI into the remote object.
        Suppose that the server returns the following object:
        <pre class="brush: js">
            {
                "name":     "Mindy Collins",
                "type":     "guest",
                "username": "mindyc"
            }
        </pre>
        The data can now be referenced and displayed in a view using a path like <b>/remote/account/data/name</b>.
        Note the 'data' component in the path.
        A remote object always places the data it loads under a top-level property called 'data'.
        Remote objects also supply a second top-level property called 'meta'.
        This property is used to store information about the status of the data contained by the remote object.
        This includes information such as the full URI the remote data was last loaded from and the status of the load
        operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        See the <a href="nub-api.html">Nub API</a> documentation for more information on the meta object, and the full set of methods available on a remote
        object.
    </p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>
        Nub provides a simple list framework for displaying array data stored in the model.
        This framework allows HTML tables or lists (i.e. OL or UL elements) to be used to display list data using all the
        formatting capabilities available in HTML.
        The framework also supports paging of large lists and allows full customization of the list pager.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before using the list framework it must be included in the page, after the line including the Nub plugin:
        <pre class="brush: xml">
            &lt;script src="jquery.nub-list.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>
        The list framework uses a couple of additional Nub classes to mark the elements within a page which are to be used by a
        list:
        <ul>
        <li><b>nub-list-row</b>: This class is used to mark the element which is to be used as the row data template.
        (i.e. within a table, this would be placed on a TR element, whilst on an unordered list it would be placed on a LI tag).
        </li>
        <li><b>nub-list-view</b>: This class is the list equivalent of the <b>nub-view</b> class, and is used to mark elements
        which will be used to display row data.
        It works in the exact same manner as the nub-view class, except that its data reference is always relative to a single row
        of the list source data.
        </li>
        </ul>
        The following example shows a simple list template, which could be used to display the
        <a href="#people-list">people list</a> used above:
        <pre class="brush: xml">
            &lt;table id="people-list" data="/everyone"&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
                    &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;tr class="nub-list-row"&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b class="nub-list-view" data="name"/&gt;&lt;td&gt;
                    &lt;td class="nub-list-view" data="age"/&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;/table&gt;
        </pre>
        The list is then initialized using the <b>nubList</b> function:
        <pre class="brush: js">
            $('#people-list').nubList();
        </pre>
        The list framework supports a number of customization options and event callbacks; these are all described in the
        <a href="nub-api.html">Nub API</a> documentation.
